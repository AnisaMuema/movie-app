INTRODUCTION

MovieHub, the next modified Netfilx, is an App that displays all movies you can imagine. But unlike Netflix, MovieHub lets you add a movie that isn't available on the App.  

#PROBLEM STATEMENT

No movie site/App on the internet can let a user add a movie of their liking.  

#SOLUTION

MovieHub can let a user add a movie of choice if it isn't on the App already, and it will be displayed on the page for other people to see. As simple as it sounds, other users will also have the ability to like or dislike the movies displayed on the home page.

#FEATURES

As a user, you should be able to:
1. see a collection of movies displayed on the home page
2. add a movie of your liking
3. search for a specific movie
4. delete a movie
5. like or dislike a movie
6. sort movies out by genre
7. sort movies out in a chronological order
8. Edit a movie's comment
9. see the movie you hover over pop out more
