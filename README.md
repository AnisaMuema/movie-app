--------------------------MovieHub----------------------------

INTRODUCTION

MovieHub, the next modified Netfilx is an App that displays all movies that you can ever think of. But unlike Netflix, MovieHub lets you add a movie of choice that isnt available on the App.  

PROBLEM STATEMENT

No movie site/App on the internet can let a user add a movie of their liking.  

SOLUTION

MovieHub can let a user add a movie of choice, if it isnt on the App already, and it will be displayed on the page for other people to see. As simple as it sounds, other users will also have the abitlity like or dislike the movies displayed on the home page.
